Iâ€™m a creative, passionate, curious and continuous learner with a strong math and statistics background. 

I am passionately curious about data and have almost 2 years of experience in :

* Data Analysis & Visualization,
* Predictive Modelling,
* Machine Learning and Deep Learning,
* Data Mining and Time Series Analysis.

I use Python and SQL as a programming language.

I continue to grow my skills.. :bee:
