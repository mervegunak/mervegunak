I am a self-learner, creative and analytical minded Data Scientist with 3 years hands-on experience. 

My main focuses are in Predictive & Mathematical Modeling, Machine Learning, and Time Series. I love doing that process of analyzing data to achieve actionable insights and spend a lot of time dedicated to my own continuous improvement and development. 

Recently, I've been developing myself in DevOps field.

I use Python and SQL as a programming language.

I continue to grow my skills :bee:
